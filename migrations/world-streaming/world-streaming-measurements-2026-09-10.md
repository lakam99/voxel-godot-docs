# Spatial streaming measurement baseline

Implementation branch: `codex/world-streaming-architecture`, created from
`2c71199` in the existing citadel worktree. Generation, physical publication,
navigation and rendering output are unchanged in this measurement milestone.

## Observation contract

September 11 correction: normal-menu startup timers remain valid, but the former
normal traversal observer relocated the player to a selected lane after loading.
Those historical movement samples are relocation-driven stress observations,
not ordinary traversal acceptance. The observer now starts at the actual spawn,
opens the generated starter door through the real interaction ray/input path,
walks outside through player physics and measures travel from there. It requires
a 64m excursion and four visited chunks as well as accumulated travel, preventing
indoor pacing from passing. Terrain holds are failures, with bounded diagnostic
samples. Screenshot work is classified separately and retained in overall cadence.

Validation on the pending retained-region candidate (`e859367` plus working-tree
changes): `artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/retained-region-normal-04/`,
random seed `atlas-98803426`, 1920x1080, 75 seconds. Actual New Game readiness
39.445s; real door opening/exit; 535.626m travel, 130.622m maximum spawn distance,
15 chunks, zero setup relocations and zero terrain holds. House-exit and final
forest images inspected. Natural exit 1, clean logs/cleanup and zero owned
processes (`godot-vbv7Ry`). **Performance fails**: post-draw p99 70.9ms / max
262.896ms; Main-script max 29.082ms. This verifies the corrected observation path,
not five-minute performance, complete regional readiness, daytime visuals or
cold-cache acceptance. The preceding new door fixture failure (`normal-03`) was
a child-collider/owning-door comparison error; it changed no production door code.

The user's loading clarification is reflected in the architecture plan: 90
seconds is provisional, with fresh creation, saved Continue and traversal
reported separately. A fresh process alone is not proof of empty generated
caches. Save v2 retains durable changes; current native terrain attaches its
generator on reload, so a Minecraft-like saved-world speedup is not yet proven.

`RuntimeRenderObservation` is an opt-in, composed playtest observer. It records
bounded histograms of frame-post-draw cadence, root-viewport render CPU/GPU time,
frame setup CPU, visible/shadow draw and primitive counts, and callback overhead.
The existing Main-script monitor is explicitly labelled as script-only timing.
GPU observations may be delayed; do not add them to CPU values or infer exact
transition-frame attribution. Cadence is not OS presentation timing. Overall
cadence includes captures and phase transitions. Per-phase cadence excludes
transitions. Capture phases are diagnostic, often too short for inference.

Logical viewport dimensions differ from output dimensions under canvas stretch.
An eight-frame owned window probe (`render-size-probe-01`) independently observed
a 1920x1080 window and image, 1280x720 logical UI, but texture.get_size() returned
2880x1620. The final observer uses Window/SubViewport size and records 3D scale
and changes in render configuration. Probe cleanup exposed the existing
unparented metrics-helper leak; its result is diagnostic, not clean acceptance.

## Citadel baseline

Command:

```text
node tools/run-citadel-candidate-teleport-playtest.mjs -Seed atlas-3376622889 -CandidateRegion "-2,-2" -SkipTutorial -ForceDaytime -ForceClearWeather -Resolution 1920x1080 -StartupTimeoutSeconds 120 -TimeoutSeconds 600 -OutputDirectory artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/candidate-teleport-architecture-baseline-01
```

Source42 and continuation42 gates were reused: instrumentation did not change
their generation/physical source. Read-only critic approved the headed launch.
The run passed 25 diagnostic checks and exited naturally with clean logs and
zero owned processes. Fresh process and isolated user data; this is not the
final cold-cache acceptance campaign.

- Ordinary startup: 19.467s; accepted source: 97.652s; scene ready: 152.814s.
- Scene publication cadence: p99 21.7ms, max 81.124ms, six intervals >33ms.
- Short input approach: 779 cadence samples, p99 17.2ms, max 29.993ms.
  Render CPU p99 5.0ms, GPU p99 7.1ms; peak 2,393 visible and 3,933 shadow draws.
- Startup cadence contains a 10,786.111ms stall. Existing script-only timings
  cannot account for this interval.
- Inspected 1920x1080 ready, courtyard, home-door and stair-landing captures.
  Citadel, terrain and trees are visible. Dark close views and grainy shadows
  remain baseline visual issues. Inspection cameras/teleports do not establish
  ordinary traversal, NPC routes, all physical behavior, or performance acceptance.

## Ordinary menu and traversal baseline

Command (each invocation used fresh isolated APPDATA/LOCALAPPDATA and save path
under its named artifact directory):

```text
node tools/run-normal-runtime-performance-pass.mjs -Resolution 1920x1080 -DurationSeconds 75 -TimeoutSeconds 300 -ReportPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/architecture-normal-baseline-03/report.json -ProgressPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/architecture-normal-baseline-03/progress.txt
```

- `architecture-normal-baseline-01`: failed fixture attempt. The stretched-menu
  click was not accepted; seed and loading observations remained empty. No world
  load took place. Corrected logical-coordinate input, explicit window sizing,
  and immediate input acknowledgement. Forced cleanup, zero owned processes.
- `architecture-normal-baseline-02`: fresh seed `atlas-71030935`, New Game ready
  in 36.806s, 595.08m traversed. Cadence p99 46.1ms, max 61.923ms, 504 intervals
  >33ms. Functional checks passed, but old direct teardown leaked resources and
  required forced cleanup. Zero owned processes. Its texture-size telemetry is
  superseded by the independent window probe; do not label it 2880p rendering.
- `architecture-normal-baseline-03`: fresh seed `atlas-83490937`, New Game ready
  in 35.821s, 310.80m traversed. Actual output 1920x1080, 3D scale 1.0, zero
  configuration changes. Cadence p99 63.2ms, max 79.949ms, 610 intervals >33ms;
  render CPU p99 13.0ms, GPU p99 19.1ms. Peak visible/shadow draws 688/5,449.
  Startup maximum 10,327.095ms. Functional checks passed; natural exit, empty
  stderr, clean cleanup and zero owned processes in
  `artifacts/node-tools/process-runs/godot-6dhjtO/watchdog.json`.

The runner now releases its unparented metrics helper and calls the existing
production graceful-quit path. Its survival observer and automated movement
remain explicitly fixture controls. A green legacy functional result does NOT
mean the new pacing contract passes: both measured traversal seeds exceed the
33ms p99 target and have recurring stalls. These are 75-second baseline samples,
not the required five-minute acceptance observations or Continue coverage.

## Verification and next cutover

- Candidate Node runner tests: 15/15.
- Owned Godot check-only: both modified runners parsed cleanly.
- `render-observer-contract-01`: 6/6 synthetic histogram/availability controls,
  clean owned exit. No gameplay claim.
- No broad gameplay suite was repeated for this observation-only milestone;
  broad and affected lifecycle/navigation coverage remain required at production
  cutovers. Prior broad42 baseline failures remain explicitly recorded in
  `CITADEL_NATIVE_SUPPORT_INTEGRATION_2026-09-10.md`.

Next: worker-prepared final masonry packets, shared material request rules,
bounded assembly/upload through the current publisher. Preserve aperture cuts,
part-completion flush boundaries (including batches above 12,000 instances),
material first-request order, exact close-up output, physical data and readiness.
Source compilation/publication and actual traversal pacing are distinct blockers.
The synchronous terrain scan in spawn selection is a plausible startup-stall
contributor to profile in the later generation cutover, not a proven timing yet.
