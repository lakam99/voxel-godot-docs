# Regional navigation publication candidate

Latest cutover builds from `889d2c1`: runtime worker preparation and segmented
uploads are connected, with current owner/revision receipts and finite live prop
collision bounds. The latest headed comparison restores all 1,752 proved false
vertical rejections; 111 lifecycle and 86 navigation checks pass. See the final
sections for commands, headed evidence and final gameplay regression results.
Regional gameplay readiness and sustained performance acceptance remain unfinished.
Earlier sections preserve the preceding milestone evidence chronologically.

Parent `5fc79d9`, branch `codex/world-streaming-architecture`. This candidate is
not yet a regional gameplay-readiness cutover. Whole-site scene publication still
gates its source artifacts, and the streaming coordinator lacks completed
structure/navigation regional acknowledgements.

## Current changes and ownership

Worker preparation compiles the existing source clearance samples into immutable
navigation tiles. The scene publication owner returns them only with the current
source binding, live root under its original parent, and actual registered door
leaves. Missing admission, world reset, retirement, changed parent and lost door
registration remain pending rather than claiming an empty ready world.

The navigation adapter consumes each door from that source owner, including when
the door body and its certified interior support occupy different tiles. Ordinary
door identity, state, opening and route execution remain in their existing owners.
The whole-artifact unresolved-crossing summary now includes doors as well as stairs.

Before mesh upload, the existing navigation mesh builder combines exactly touching
axis-aligned rectangles from the same declared source geometry group. It retains
every original surface ID in the installation receipt. Single-axis grades merge
only across their level axis, preserving all corner heights. Different heights,
holes and irregular polygons are preserved. Shared sample and tile boundaries now
derive from integer grid coordinates, avoiding accumulated float32 discrepancies
at kilometre-scale coordinates. No baking backend, raster size, warning setting,
route search, motor or door execution is changed.

## Evidence and failures retained

- `regional-owner-job-02`: 392 synthetic publication/lifecycle checks pass, including
  stale binding, same-transform reparenting, cancellation and source retirement.
  Its watchdog records exit 0, clean cleanup and zero owned members. Attempt 01
  passed its checks but its wrapper expected a report file where this fixture
  expects a directory; it is retained as a failed invocation.
- `regional-owner-nav-02`: existing navigation-world suite, 86/86 pass. Watchdog
  `godot-lqSk4c`. Earlier `regional-owner-nav-01` also passed before rectangle merging.
- `regional-owner-nav-lifecycle-01.json`: 39 navigation lifecycle/receipt and
  synthetic coverage checks pass. Watchdog `godot-4X79QR`.
- `candidate-teleport-regional-nav-owner-01`: real Main scene completed generation,
  rendering and captures, then the new publication diagnostic incorrectly assumed
  terrain surfaces have explicit IDs. Terrain uses cell/span IDs. The error
  watchdog stopped the job and proved zero owned processes; this is not a passed
  run. The fixture now derives required IDs through the production descriptor.
- Its saved first tile, `navigation-tile--206,-174.bin`, independently exposed a
  production synchronization warning: 37 edge errors among 2,252 polygons. Exact
  edge inspection found neither zero-length nor multiply owned exact edges; the
  dense internal sample boundaries conflicted in server synchronization.
- `regional-owner-tile-replay-03`: replay of that unchanged actual tile through the
  production service now has 275 polygons, retains all 2,327 declared surface IDs
  and its door link, and receives a ready source-matched installation receipt.
  Logs are clean; exit 0, cleanup passed and owned zero. Earlier replay 02 removed
  the warning but observed before synchronization completed. Replay 03 waits on
  the actual receipt with a bounded deadline. This is saved-source service
  evidence, not live player/NPC acceptance.

The existing headed candidate now captures views first, then submits actual tile
snapshots through the live production navigation service and records required
surface/crossing installation receipts. Saved tile binaries preserve geometry;
JSON progress omits repeated full-geometry signature strings. This diagnostic
does not prove route connectivity, NPC movement or frame pacing.

## Next verification

`candidate-teleport-regional-nav-owner-02` finished the real Main scene and all
42 tile installation receipts covered 164,527 declared surfaces and 77 links.
However, 29 engine synchronization warnings made the wrapper fail. Natural exit
was 0, cleanup passed and no owned processes remained. This is not a passed run.
The worst measured tile installation was 439.264ms; publication is not bounded yet.

The saved snapshots were recompiled from their accepted source while retaining
the saved live surface selection. `regional-owner-recompiled-02` retained every
saved surface ID. `regional-owner-all-replay-01` installed these 42 tiles through
the production service in one shared map and received complete receipts, but one
engine warning still reports two edge errors. The runner correctly exits 1.
This is service diagnostic evidence, not live gameplay acceptance.

`regional-owner-all-edge-audit-06` identifies the remaining crowded raster cell:
tile `-210,-176`, the approximately 0.19m square terminal fragment of source paving
segment 23. The source contains adjacent narrow paving segment 86, but that
segment is absent from the saved published surface selection near the fragment.
Giving adjoining parts a common source geometry group consequently did not remove
this isolated fragment. Determine whether source sampling or live filtering omits
the adjoining support before changing geometry. Do not drop the fragment, fill a
gap speculatively, or tune server raster settings to conceal the discrepancy.

The follow-up `regional-owner-small-support-03` proves that the fourth corner of
the fragment violates the existing 0.52m clearance from source foundation
`castle_terrace_block_02_left_17`; the diagonal predicate misses it. Source
publication and live building-surface filtering now explicitly check the full
rectangle through the existing clearance owner. Segment callers keep the original
predicate and default behavior. `regional-owner-recompiled-03` rejects 439 source
patches for actual footprint obstruction, recording the removed IDs explicitly;
it does not claim unchanged surface parity. No physical/visual geometry is removed.

`regional-owner-all-replay-02` then installs all 42 saved/recompiled tiles with
complete declared receipts and zero engine warnings, natural exit 0, cleanup
passed and authoritative zero owned processes. `regional-owner-nav-lifecycle-02`
passes 45 synthetic/service checks, including grade/group identity and full
rectangle clearance; watchdog `godot-eyp3g1`. `regional-owner-nav-03` passes 86
navigation-world checks. `regional-owner-job-03` passes 392 publication/lifecycle
checks. A preceding job invocation supplied a disallowed full source path to the
generic contract wrapper; it was rejected before launch and corrected to the
existing runner's filename convention.

## Full headed candidate 03

```text
node tools/run-citadel-candidate-teleport-playtest.mjs -Seed atlas-3376622889 -CandidateRegion "-2,-2" -SpawnCell "-3334,-2666" -SkipTutorial -ForceDaytime -ForceClearWeather -Resolution 1920x1080 -StartupTimeoutSeconds 180 -TimeoutSeconds 600 -OutputDirectory artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/candidate-teleport-regional-nav-owner-03
```

All checks pass, with natural exit 0, no engine warnings/errors, clean cleanup,
zero owned processes and no changes to the frozen sources. Initial spawn is
selected before player attachment and terrain startup, with no setup teleports.
Startup is 87.330s and the whole diagnostic including captures/navigation is
187.046s. Existing dependency caches were present: this is not cold acceptance.
The scene audit finds 3,312 collider shapes with zero identity mismatches, 20
doors, 178 furniture bodies and all source crossings resolved. All 42 live tiles
receive revision-matched receipts for 163,974 surfaces and 77 links.

Inspected initial spawn, ready exterior, overview 2, gatehouse stair base and a
home door. Nearby terrain is drawn at release; the citadel and stair landing are
visible. The close-up views remain very dark and the distant terrain boundary is
visible from the elevated diagnostic camera. These are unresolved visual limits.
The input-driven approach passes, but this runner does not exercise NPC traversal
or walking every door/stair connection. Camera inspection placements are diagnostic.

The short approach's post-draw cadence p99 is 17.4ms, max 19.832ms. Whole-site scene
publication reaches 80.650ms and the worst tile install takes 401.567ms despite only
28 merged polygons (17,619 retained surface identities). Main-thread descriptor,
identity and registration costs still need bounded preparation/publication.
Startup includes a 2,619.258ms post-draw interval. These measurements do not meet
the complete performance contract and are not a five-minute traversal campaign.

Existing successful ordinary New Game/Continue loading-screen evidence remains in
`WORLD_STREAMING_CONTINUE_2026-09-11.md`.

## Broad regression and pending attribution

```

The run finished at 158/163. Watchdog `godot-DWuGe1` records natural functional
exit 1, no timeout or forced cleanup, cleanup passed and authoritative zero owned
processes. Inspected its final screenshot: terrain, the actor/dialogue and held
item are present; some trees visibly remain incomplete.

- `generated_environment_prop_visuals` and
  `generated_environment_prop_authority_and_static_fallback`: tree recipe still
  building at 720 fixture frames. This failure class was recorded on the unchanged
  reference with the earlier seed.
- `character_asset_pack_ready`: same previously recorded 40 assets / 11 families.
- `sanctuary_beacon_raid_system`: `contested false`, all other listed conditions
  true. This fixture calls charge updates directly without physics between them;
  it is not independent evidence of a live combat regression.
- `town_exit_slope_apron`: max step 1.47m against the unchanged 1.24m limit,
  radius 25, apron 22, direction `(-1,0)` at offset 35. This is a source terrain
  rule failure and must not be waived because the navigation candidate passed.

The full matching headed baseline run completed in the independently verified clean `d6314ed`
checkout `../voxel-biome-world-godot-streaming-reference-20260911`, output
`artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/regional-owner-baseline-broad-01`. Same
command/options, with those output paths substituted. It also finishes at 158/163:
every pass/fail result and all five failure detail strings match the candidate
exactly. Watchdog `godot-kc6625` records natural functional exit 1, no timeout,
cleanup passed and authoritative zero owned processes. No new or worsened broad
failure is demonstrated by this comparison. The wrapper seed affects this town
probe; the earlier broad run using `atlas-338921745` was not a same-seed comparison.
These baseline failures remain defects, not waived acceptance checks.

The existing ordinary headed New Game/Continue runner passes on this
candidate in `artifacts/npc/node-production-runs/save-continue-Ri8NOS/`:

```text
node tools/npc/run-tutorial-save-continue-playtest.mjs --visible --timeout-seconds 360 --stale-progress-seconds 90
```

Random seed `atlas-76288624`, two real main-menu processes, no gameplay-affecting
flags, no fixed frame override, 1280x720. Both stages and the forbidden-call guard
pass. New Game click-to-unlock is 38.921s; Continue click-to-first observation is
35.382s (an upper bound including brief fixture setup). These use existing asset
dependencies and do not constitute the 1080p cold-cache performance campaign.

Both stage timelines show `Drawing nearby terrain`, `Nearby terrain displayed`,
then `Gameplay prerequisites ready`. The player opens the starter door through
input, acknowledges dialogue, and saves the generic go-home intent. Continue
restores it through ordinary game systems. Its trace records home-door opening at
56.449s, closure at 57.866s and settled strict-home arrival at 58.279s wall time.
Inspected the first restored player view and final observer capture: the latter
shows the NPC inside a furnished, floored home with the door closed. The first
observation already places her 24.729m from the starter porch, so the reported
porch-clearance delay is not a fresh departure measurement. This is live tutorial
home/save regression evidence, not citadel crossing or sustained traversal proof.

Watchdogs `godot-ySkEhw` and `godot-kqwnDn` both record natural exit 0, clean cleanup,
no forced cleanup and authoritative zero owned processes. No engine errors or
warnings were reported. The baseline checkout remains unchanged at `d6314ed`.

## Next architectural cutover

### Shared geometry preparation and pending-publication work in progress

The next implementation batch extracts the existing vertex, polygon and source
ownership compilation into `NavigationMeshPreparation`. Both ordinary service
installation and the worker use this single geometry implementation. The new
`NavigationPublicationWorker` reuses `BuildingPublicationWorker` ownership,
cancellation, stale-token and off-thread retirement machinery. Its prepared
descriptor preserves the ordinary canonical signature and sealed field identity;
live door state continues to use the existing service overlay.

This is not yet a runtime asynchronous cutover: the production tile producer has
not been connected to this worker, and upload segmentation and retained old
installations still need implementation. Do not infer reduced gameplay stalls
from a worker contract.

Current verification:

- `regional-async-building-worker-01`: 64/64 existing worker lifecycle checks,
  clean engine, natural exit 0, cleanup passed and owned zero.
- `regional-async-all-replay-01`: all 42 actual `regional-nav-owner-03` saved
  production tiles install with complete receipts, 163,974 surfaces, clean engine,
  natural exit 0 and owned zero. This is service replay, not live movement.
- `regional-async-baseline-replay-01`: the exact `regional-owner-recompiled-03`
  input used by the prior committed replay; all 42 tiles and 164,088 surfaces
  pass. Per-tile surface, link, polygon and vertex counts match
  `regional-owner-all-replay-02` without differences. Both replay commands use the
  existing artifact `replay-all-tiles.gd` via the Node building-contract runner,
  `NAV_EDGE_INPUT` selecting the stated source directory and
  `NAV_TILE_REPLAY_REPORT` selecting the report.
- `regional-worker-contract-03.json`: 70/72 synthetic/service checks; worker
  preparation, canonical signature, geometry, real revision acknowledgement and
  off-thread retirement pass. The two failures reproduce discarded rejected
  installations and their missing retries. They are focused fixtures for the
  pending-publication fix, not newly observed headed gameplay failures.
- `regional-worker-contract-demand-01.json`: the completed fix passes 72/72.
  Unavailable sources and rejected installs retain demand; metadata-only LOD
  requests queue authoritative preparation rather than installing an empty tile
  or doing unbudgeted source construction in the actor loop. Retry rounds span
  time-limited calls. Production consumers cache only installation success or
  explicit authoritative empty output.
- `regional-async-nav-01`: existing navigation-world suite, Both time modes,
  86/86 passed. `regional-async-streaming-save-01` stopped on synthetic fixture
  engine errors (`make_entry` reads global transforms before scene attachment;
  placement reads a missing World3D). Its partial 36-check report has no assertion
  failures and is not a passing suite. The clean `d6314ed` reference run at
  `regional-async-baseline-streaming-save-01` reproduces all 36 result statuses
  and byte-identical stderr. Both owned watchdogs (`godot-CCJURm` current,
  `godot-HVZCRK` baseline) forcibly stop after the engine errors and report
  authoritative zero owned processes, but `cleanupPassed=false`. This is an
  unchanged synthetic-fixture failure, not live streaming/save acceptance.

The frozen candidate's headed initial-location run
`candidate-teleport-regional-async-01` passes all 29 checks, including live
navigation installation. Command:

```text
node tools/run-citadel-candidate-teleport-playtest.mjs -Seed atlas-3376622889 -CandidateRegion "-2,-2" -SpawnCell "-3334,-2666" -SkipTutorial -ForceDaytime -ForceClearWeather -Resolution 1920x1080 -StartupTimeoutSeconds 180 -TimeoutSeconds 600 -OutputDirectory artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/candidate-teleport-regional-async-01
```

Startup took 88.444s and the diagnostic completed at 192.456s using existing
dependencies, with zero setup placements. Inspected `initial_spawn_ready.png`:
nearby terrain is continuously drawn at release. `ready.png` shows the citadel
and trees published afterward; the gatehouse stair landing and home-door captures
retain their physical-looking surfaces and opening. Close views remain too dark.
Also inspected courtyard, overview and furniture captures: roof/street layout and
window-side furniture remain present. The elevated overview still exposes a
sharp terrain-render boundary beside the site; this is unresolved presentation
evidence, not proof that terrain volume is absent there.
Scene audit retains 3,312 colliders, 20 doors, 178 furniture bodies, 243,227 visual
instances, 739 meshes and 1,531 MultiMeshes. The process exits naturally with code
0, clean engine logs, cleanup passed and owned zero. This diagnostic still does
not certify ordinary NPC citadel crossings or sustained streaming performance.

Post-draw frame intervals in the short ordinary input approach have p99 21.3ms
and maximum 32.075ms. Scene publication still reaches 81.501ms, and startup
2,702.019ms. The script-only monitor reports maximum 9.932ms and no last spike;
its narrower scope must not conceal the render-observer stalls. These results
do not meet whole-run streaming acceptance and do not establish a performance
improvement from the pending worker integration.

Final broad regression command:

```text
node tools/run-playtest.mjs -Visible -Seed atlas-648215039 -ReportPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/regional-async-broad-01/report.json -ProgressPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/regional-async-broad-01/progress.txt -ScreenshotPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/regional-async-broad-01/playtest.png -TimeoutSeconds 600
```

Result: 158/163. All 163 pass/fail results and all five failure details exactly
match `regional-owner-broad-01`, whose same-seed comparison to clean `d6314ed`
is recorded above. Watchdog `godot-n80OxM` reports natural exit 1, clean logs,
cleanup passed and authoritative zero owned processes. No new assertion failure.

The independent subagent also ran the existing real main-menu regression once:

```text
node tools/npc/run-tutorial-save-continue-playtest.mjs --visible --timeout-seconds 360 --stale-progress-seconds 90
```

`artifacts/npc/node-production-runs/save-continue-0mAkmk/report.json` passes both
headed stages for random seed `atlas-75056485`; no gameplay-affecting flags and
the forbidden-call guard passes. New Game saves the acknowledged knock and generic
go-home intent. Continue restores it; its live trace and inspected first/final
screenshots show the NPC approach, open her home door, enter strict home and close
the door. Watchdogs `godot-bB48HB` and `godot-fD61OC` exit naturally with code 0,
clean logs, cleanup passed and authoritative zero owned processes. This is
tutorial/save/door regression evidence, not NPC citadel-crossing acceptance.
This run overlapped the broad fixture, so neither concurrent run's timings count
as load or frame-performance acceptance. No test processes remain owned.

Whole-site publication still gates tile source delivery. Regional owner
acknowledgements and bounded worker-prepared mesh/identity publication are
unfinished. Pending demand retention is implemented and production regression is
recorded above. Read-only inspection also flags live collision bounds:
fallback records start at the body origin vertically, while pitched box XZ bounds
use the center plane. These need authoritative-volume treatment before claiming
regional physical completeness. Route search, motor and traffic remain unchanged.

Broad gameplay regression and real movement remain required. The current source
publication work does not satisfy bounded uploads, regional traversal readiness,
the cold-load campaign, distance tiers or the five-minute 1080p performance target.

## Runtime worker publication cutover (September 11)

GeneratedWorldNavigationAdapter now captures a value-only immutable source envelope
from its authoritative tile output. The envelope includes the actual world seed;
its weak producer reference stays outside worker input. NavigationPublicationQueue
uses the existing BuildingPublicationWorker lifecycle through its navigation
specialization. Descriptor expansion, geometry buffers, canonical signatures and
surface-ownership validation run on that owned worker. NavigationMesh creation,
buffer readback, segmented polygon uploads and NavigationServer installation remain
on the main thread. The slot advances once per frame, with the existing 4ms budget
and at most 128 polygons per segment. The route publication queue retains demand
while the slot is occupied; there is no second topology or route authority.

Installed geometry stays in place until a complete current replacement is ready.
Complete seed/source/generation bindings prevent an equal-geometry cache hit from
reusing another world's installation. Stale revisions and lost weak owners cancel
pending work. World reset and graceful quit detach and drain owned descriptors;
direct scene destruction joins the same retirement protocol. Door removal retires
the old prepared descriptor off-thread and preserves its asynchronous origin when
the remaining door-data shell awaits fresh authoritative publication.

Focused verification uses the existing runners:

- `regional-runtime-async-lifecycle-03.json`: 95/95 synthetic/service checks,
  including segmented uploads, current NavigationServer receipts, stale/lost
  ownership, cross-seed replacement, portal filtering, reusable reset and shutdown.
  Natural exit 0, clean engine logs, cleanup passed, authoritative zero owned
  processes (`godot-jUSTn7`). The first runtime lifecycle run exposed a real
  cross-seed inner-cache defect; the current binding comparison fixes it.
- `regional-runtime-async-nav-02`: 86/86 navigation checks in both time modes.
  The first run's four failures came from a synthetic producer lacking its seed
  and a source-scan guard treating the prepared packet's mesh field as live-scene
  scanning. The existing fixture now declares its seed and allows only that exact
  packet assignment; its other scene-scanning prohibitions remain intact.

The headed `candidate-teleport-runtime-async-01` run used the preceding candidate
command with that fresh output directory. All 28 checks pass; startup took 87.569s
and the diagnostic completed at 195.086s. It selected the initial spawn before
attachment, with zero setup placements. All 42 navigation tiles used worker
preparation and received actual revision-matched installation acknowledgements.
Natural exit 0, clean engine logs, cleanup passed and authoritative zero owned
processes. This run preceded the subsequent focused portal-retirement correction;
that correction does not alter source geometry or visual publication.

Inspected initial terrain, courtyard, overview, gatehouse stair landing, home-door
and furniture captures. The citadel is visibly present; counts remain 3,312
colliders, 20 doors, 178 furniture bodies, 243,227 instances, 739 meshes and 1,531
MultiMeshes. Close-up darkness and the sharp terrain presentation boundary remain
unresolved. Scene state still explicitly reports `gameplayReady=false` and
`door_activation_pending`; these captures are not whole-site gameplay acceptance.

The short ordinary-input approach has post-draw p99 19.4ms and maximum 26.743ms.
Scene-publication maximum is 70.033ms, startup maximum 2,667.589ms. Courtyard fixed
view has p99 26.1ms, maximum 36.739ms and up to 2,211 draw calls. The script-only
monitor's maximum is 8.687ms with no last spike; its narrower scope does not
overrule the actual frame intervals. No cold-cache, five-minute traversal or 4ms
whole-pipeline performance acceptance is claimed.

Final-code broad command (before adding rejection diagnostics only):

```text
node tools/run-playtest.mjs -Visible -Seed atlas-648215039 -ReportPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/regional-runtime-async-broad-01/report.json -ProgressPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/regional-runtime-async-broad-01/progress.txt -ScreenshotPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/regional-runtime-async-broad-01/playtest.png -TimeoutSeconds 600
```

Result: 158/163. All 163 statuses and all five failure details exactly match
`regional-async-broad-01`. Watchdog `godot-JfkEue`: natural exit 1, clean engine
logs, cleanup passed and authoritative zero owned processes.

The existing headed New Game/Continue command recorded above passes again in
`artifacts/npc/node-production-runs/save-continue-kkYEVe/report.json`, random seed
`atlas-63661055`. No gameplay-affecting flags; forbidden-call guard passed. The
subagent inspected the real movement trace and captures: home door opened before
crossing, strict interior arrival and closure. Both stages exit naturally with
code 0, clean logs, cleanup passed and owned zero (`godot-O81qwa`, `godot-e080ZD`).
These runs overlapped the broad fixture; their timings are excluded from
performance acceptance. This proves tutorial/save/door regression, not citadel
NPC crossings or 64m regional readiness.

The source-parity audit blocks promotion pending investigation. Current headed
tile inputs contain 157,760 surfaces versus the previous headed run's 164,088:
6,305 building surfaces and 23 terrain surfaces are removed across 26 tiles.
Retained geometry, all 77 links, portal records, accepted blueprint/furnishings
and durable edits match. The change occurs in live filtering before worker
compilation; complete receipts cannot establish that those rejections are valid.
The next headed snapshot must capture the actual rejecting collider identities,
bounds and source revisions. Maximum measured final installation is 270us and
source sealing 1,528us, but these exclude upload segments and the expensive live
source/filtering work; they are not a complete before/after timing comparison.

### Rejection provenance and finite live collision bounds

`candidate-teleport-runtime-async-02` adds `-CaptureNavigationRejections` to the
headed command. The ordinary launcher still rejects inherited VOXEL modes; its
explicit option sets only the requested observation mode after validation. An
earlier inherited-mode attempt stopped before launching Godot. The source audit
now also hashes new untracked scripts. All 15 existing Node runner tests pass
(`regional-runtime-async-runner-tests-02.log`).

The instrumented run passes with clean logs, unchanged hashed sources, natural
exit 0, cleanup passed and owned zero. Startup 87.927s, diagnostic 196.626s;
inspected initial terrain and ready captures. All 42 tiles use worker preparation.
The production queue records 44 preparations/uploads, maximum advance 143us and
83 stale discards while live source revisions change. This excludes upstream
filtering and instrumentation overhead and is not full-pipeline acceptance.

Saved rejection records confirm a real source defect. Compared with the earlier
headed source, this run excludes 5,356 building surfaces and 22 terrain surfaces.
Of the building losses, 1,752 are provably false vertical rejections: actual
enabled collider bounds end below the surface, but the prop record extends to
infinite height. For example, prop `atlas-3376622889:-3321,-2838:24` has a sphere
ending at Y=43.27459 yet rejects `urban_market_plaza` at Y=44.46488 in tile
`-208,-178`. The remaining 3,604 have vertical bounding overlap; this alone does
not prove a physical intersection. Terrain losses are separately attributed to
20 static-cell blockers and two prop-clearance exclusions. Evidence:
`runtime-async-02-rejection-analysis.json`, `runtime-async-02-saved-source-comparison.json`
and the 42 `navigation-rejections-*.bin` snapshots. Transformed debug-mesh bounds
are conservative, especially for rotated spheres; do not infer exact contact
from their overlap.

The adapter now derives finite world bounds from actual enabled Box, Sphere,
Cylinder and Capsule collision shapes. Initial and incremental publication share
the collector; box bounds include their full transformed volume. Existing prop
record identity and aggregate cardinality remain intact. Unsupported/invalid
sources report structured failure and retain retryable publication rather than
inventing a column or silently publishing empty geometry. Existing furnishing
manifests and probe/route algorithms remain unchanged.

`regional-finite-bounds-lifecycle-02.json` passes 111 synthetic/service checks;
`regional-finite-bounds-nav-world-01/report.json` passes 86 checks in both time
modes. Watchdogs `godot-VunKsl` and `godot-mNpAOc`: natural exit 0, clean engine
logs, cleanup passed and owned zero. Lifecycle attempt 01 was a new fixture
type-inference error, corrected before the passing run. Headed recovery and
final-code gameplay regression remain required before promotion.

The corrected headed run `candidate-teleport-finite-bounds-01` uses the same
instrumented command with that fresh output directory. All 28 checks pass;
startup 88.335s, diagnostic 195.609s, natural exit 0, clean engine logs, unchanged
hashed sources, cleanup passed and authoritative zero owned processes. Inspected
its courtyard capture: geometry/layout remain visibly present; previous lighting
and presentation limitations remain open. All 42 worker-prepared tile receipts
are current and all 77 links remain present. Queue maximum advance is 152us,
excluding upstream source work; source revision churn caused 100 stale discards.

Direct saved-evidence comparison resolves the false-rejection defect:

- All 1,752 previously false vertical-rejection surface IDs are restored.
- Of 186 previously XZ-separated IDs, 158 restore; all 28 remaining cite a
  different rejecting prop.
- Of 3,418 possible-overlap IDs, 236 restore and 3,182 remain (2,992 same prop,
  190 different prop). Bounding overlap is not proof of physical contact.
- There are 2,177 added and 548 removed building surfaces, with no changes to
  retained facts. Every new removal has a captured sphere-prop record; none is
  unexplained. One additional terrain exclusion cites a static-cell prop blocker.
- Actual seed/candidate, accepted source/binding, blueprint and furnishing plan
  match exactly. No source geometry was lost during worker compilation.

Evidence: `finite-bounds-01-direct-rejection-comparison.json` and
`finite-bounds-01-vs-runtime-async-02.json`, produced by the read-only saved-value
comparison. This establishes publication/source parity and the diagnosed bounds
repair; it does not certify every physical crossing or whole-site gameplay.

The final-code existing real-menu save/Continue command also passes in
`artifacts/npc/node-production-runs/save-continue-Nmc9VP/report.json`, random seed
`atlas-51653816`. The trace and inspected captures show approach with the door
closed, opening before crossing, strict interior arrival, then closure. Watchdogs
`godot-h0e9pD` and `godot-Y6YZMY` exit naturally with code 0, clean logs, cleanup
passed and owned zero. No gameplay-affecting flags; timings are excluded because
the broad fixture ran concurrently. This is tutorial/save/home regression evidence,
not citadel crossing or sustained-performance acceptance.

Final broad command:

```text
node tools/run-playtest.mjs -Visible -Seed atlas-648215039 -ReportPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/regional-finite-bounds-broad-01/report.json -ProgressPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/regional-finite-bounds-broad-01/progress.txt -ScreenshotPath artifacts/citadel-runtime-integration/regional-finite-bounds-broad-01/playtest.png -TimeoutSeconds 600
```

Result: 158/163. All 163 statuses and all five failure details exactly match
`regional-runtime-async-broad-01`; no new or worsened assertion failure. Watchdog
`godot-A9uZP6` exits naturally with code 1, clean engine logs, cleanup passed and
authoritative zero owned processes. No owned test processes remain.

The runtime navigation publication and finite-bounds repair are verified for this
milestone. Whole-site scene readiness still does not mean regional gameplay
readiness: structure/navigation dependency composition, actual crossing acceptance,
partial publication checkpoints, distance tiers and the full performance campaign
remain outstanding. Route search, motor, door execution, traffic and save v2 remain
their existing authorities.
