# Phase 13 Report - Legacy Removal, Static Audit, Release Gate, And Acceptance Evidence

## 1. Phase Identification

- Phase: 13 - Legacy Removal, Static Audit, Release Gate, And Acceptance Report
- Branch: `npc-pathfinding/phase-13-finalize`
- Date: 2026-06-27
- Scope status: focused NPC suites, broad playtest, static audit, world signature, branch all-runner, merge, and merged `master` all-runner pass.
- Base commit before Phase 13 branch changes: `56119cef054cd444f6e9b87886b66054936785d0`
- Branch implementation/report commit: `4e1d893ec9fd2de7e6dd90461250c2fdd4ce9521`
- Merge commit: `772d54a048be1a31790f83f73277ce367b3cbe2b`
- Post-merge `master` evidence commit: this report update

## 2. Objective

Phase 13 removes migration debt, proves there is one authoritative NPC autonomy/navigation/movement/door stack, and records acceptance evidence for the replacement stack.

Required scope from the specification:

- remove runtime dual-stack selection and migration-era architecture switches;
- remove legacy `scripts/npc_nav` classes by moving the remaining authoritative implementations under `scripts/npc_ai/`;
- remove `NpcSystem` job movement, random day-target movement, snap fallback movement, door pending-close ownership, and direct route algorithms;
- remove blind door toggle usage and migrate player-facing door use to a desired-state request;
- migrate tests to the phase stack without deleting coverage;
- update architecture and agent documentation;
- run prohibited-shortcut static audits;
- run every focused NPC suite under the required time modes;
- run the branch all-runner, merge to `master`, and rerun the all-runner;
- verify startup, saves, story, visuals, deterministic world signature, and observation evidence.

## 3. Pre-Phase State And Risks

Phase 12 left the branch and `master` green with soak, failure recovery, LOD, save, and observation hardening in place. The remaining Phase 13 risk was not missing behavior, but migration residue:

- old class names could remain as active runtime references;
- `NpcSystem` could still contain direct job-route movement or route mutation fallback behavior;
- blind door toggles could remain reachable by NPCs or player input;
- transient route or traffic state could still leak into saves;
- event-driven topology could be stale in synthetic tests that drive NPC updates without normal physics frames;
- traffic updates could be advanced twice when a test called both the autonomy traffic clock and the public door-policy update;
- report evidence could overstate branch or master status before the required gates actually ran.

The dirty files listed by `git status --short` are the intentional Phase 13 implementation, documentation, and test updates.

## 4. Implementation Summary

Single authoritative stack:

- The remaining route, movement, navigation, and semantic planner implementations were moved out of `scripts/npc_nav/` and into their owned `scripts/npc_ai/` domains:
  - `scripts/npc_ai/navigation/GeneratedWorldNavigationAdapter.gd`
  - `scripts/npc_ai/routing/NpcRouteCoordinatorAdapter.gd`
  - `scripts/npc_ai/movement/NpcRouteMovementController.gd`
  - `scripts/npc_ai/behavior/NpcSemanticGoalPlanner.gd`
- `NpcNavigationCoordinator.gd` now references the renamed phase stack classes and applies navigation events before route repair decisions.
- `scripts/npc_nav/` has no files and the empty local directory was removed.

`NpcSystem` reduction:

- `update_npc()` now delegates NPC behavior to the autonomy system instead of running direct fallback, wander, or job movement.
- Public NPC traffic, route, and door integration methods remain only as stable adapters to the composed services.
- Job phase execution moved to `NpcPlanExecutor.gd`.
- Door policy updates now advance traffic exactly once when tests call `advance_traffic()` directly before `update_door_policies()`.
- `process_navigation_changes()` is flushed from `update_door_policies()` so tight synthetic loops that do not wait for a physics tick still see event-driven topology changes.

Door and traffic hardening:

- Player door input is routed through `request_player_door_use`; no `toggle_door` or `request_door_toggle` callers remain in production scripts, scenes, tools, or `AGENTS.md`.
- Active door crossings are keyed by portal and actor so one actor cannot overwrite another actor's crossing state.
- Route-generation replacement no longer releases granted active portal crossings before the door release path clears them.
- Stale pending traffic groups are treated as `pending_replan` so a renewed request replans against current blockers.
- Door lookahead and portal crossing duration were tuned to keep door actions intact through approach, crossing, release, and safe close.

Navigation events and generated-world continuity:

- `GeneratedWorldNavigationAdapter.gd` uses event revisions instead of scene-tree hash scans to decide when topology snapshots need to rebuild.
- Dynamic props created through the relevant main/playtest factories now notify the NPC system after insertion.
- The adapter still scans prop/chunk roots when rebuilding the generated-world snapshot for blocker cells. That scan does not determine revision and is not the removed per-frame scene hash path.

Determinism and saves:

- NPC profile timing defaults derive from stable profile/body keys instead of raw runtime randomness.
- `canFight` remains a combat capability, not guard duty.
- Runtime route cells/actions remain transient compatibility diagnostics and are stripped by save snapshot filtering.
- Old-save defaults and new save round-trips remain covered by focused streaming/save tests.

Defects found and fixed during Phase 13:

- A typed GDScript inference issue in the traffic-clock guard failed parser startup. The guard now uses an explicit `bool`.
- Broad playtest exposed double traffic advancement when a manual traffic tick and door-policy tick both ran in the same synthetic loop. `NpcAutonomySystem` now tracks explicit external traffic advancement and `NpcSystem` consumes that marker.
- Broad playtest then exposed stale topology in direct synthetic town loops where new props were created and NPCs were advanced without a physics frame. Prop creation now emits navigation events, and `update_door_policies()` flushes pending navigation changes.
- Two-NPC door crossing diagnostics exposed active crossing overwrite risk. Door traversal active keys now include both portal and actor.
- Traffic diagnostics exposed stale pending group reuse after blocker release. Renewed pending requests now replan against current state.

- `scripts/npc_nav/NpcRoutePlanner.gd` moved to `scripts/npc_ai/routing/NpcRouteCoordinatorAdapter.gd`

## 6. Data/API Contracts Introduced Or Changed

- `NpcConstants.ARCHITECTURE_VERSION` is now `phase13_authoritative_stack`.
- `NpcConstants.NPC_MOVEMENT_STACK` is now `character_body_route_motor`.
- `NpcSystem.request_player_door_use()` is the player-facing desired-state door API.
- `NpcAutonomySystem.advance_traffic(delta, mark_external := true)` records explicit external traffic advancement.
- `NpcAutonomySystem.consume_external_traffic_advance()` lets public door-policy updates avoid double advancement.
- `NpcSystem.notify_navigation_prop_created(prop_id, body)` is called by dynamic prop factories after adding generated props to the scene tree.
- Route/action dictionaries remain runtime diagnostics for public compatibility and test introspection, but save filtering removes transient route, reservation, avoidance, queue, and planner state.

## 7. Migration/Compatibility Behavior

`NpcPathing.gd` remains only as a stable public facade for older callers. It delegates to `NpcNavigationCoordinator.gd` and does not own topology, route search, movement, goals, traffic, or doors.

NPC dictionaries still expose selected route fields because existing HUD/debug/tests inspect them, but they are runtime state. `NpcSystem.create_save_entry()` and `NpcSimulationLodService` filtering exclude transient route cells/actions, reservation IDs, avoidance IDs, planner queues, and debug traces from durable saves.

Old saves with missing fields still load through defaulted profile, home, schedule, and state fields. New saves round-trip durable state only.

## 15. Deviation Register

None.

## 16. Known Issues/Debt

No known issue is being carried as a Phase 13 gate exception.

## 17. Static Audit Results

Production legacy/preload search:

```powershell
rg -n "legacy|scripts/npc_nav|NpcNavigationWorld|NpcRoutePlanner|NpcLocomotionController|NpcGoalPlanner|from_legacy_profile|update_legacy_npc|migrate_legacy_duty|LEGACY_LOCOMOTION_MODE|wanderTimer|update_wander_target|npc_navigation_legacy|MAX_ITERATIONS" scripts\NpcSystem.gd scripts\npc_ai scenes tools AGENTS.md
```

Result: exit 1, no production matches.

Door toggle search:

```powershell
rg -n "toggle_door|request_door_toggle" scripts scenes tools AGENTS.md docs/npc_pathfinding/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

Result: exit 1, no matches.

Old scene-scan/hash navigation revision search:

```powershell
rg -n "navigation.*hash|hash.*navigation|revision.*hash|hash.*revision|revision.*get_children|get_children.*revision|scan.*revision|revision.*scan|scene.*revision|revision.*scene" scripts\NpcSystem.gd scripts\npc_ai
```

Result: exit 1, no matches.

Unsafe timeout close search:

```powershell
rg -n "timeout|timer|force.*close|close.*force|occupancy.*timeout|expired" scripts\npc_ai\interactions scripts\NpcSystem.gd
```

Result: one unrelated `jobTimer` default in `NpcSystem.gd`; no door timeout safety bypass.

Legacy path directory check:

```powershell
Test-Path -LiteralPath scripts\npc_nav; rg --files scripts\npc_nav 2>$null
```

Result: `False`; no files.

Allowed transform/placement matches:

- `NpcSafePlacementService.gd` writes `global_position`/`position` only for spawn, promotion, and load-restore placement after capsule validation.
- `NpcRouteMovementController.gd` and `NpcSafePlacementService.gd` write `query.transform` for physics shape queries only.
- `CharacterMotor3D.gd` and route/interaction services read body positions for state, progress, and queries; they do not assign normal route transforms.

Allowed lifecycle collision-mask matches:

- `NpcSimulationLodService.gd` sets collision layer/mask to `0` only during abstract LOD demotion after `can_demote()` succeeds, then restores saved masks on safe promotion.

Allowed runtime route-state matches:

- `routeCells` and `routeActions` remain transient runtime diagnostics and route execution state.
- `NpcSystem.create_save_entry()` strips `routeCells`, `routeActions`, `pathWaypoints`, active door metadata, and `trafficWaitReason`.
- `NpcSimulationLodService` strips route cells/actions, reservations, avoidance IDs, planner queues, and debug traces from abstract/lifecycle save-facing data.

Allowed scene-tree scans:

- `NpcSystem` has bounded forage/job resource target scans for smart-object candidate discovery, not navigation revision.
- `GeneratedWorldNavigationAdapter.gd` scans prop/chunk roots while rebuilding a generated-world snapshot, not to infer revision each frame.

Allowed deterministic random matches:

- `NpcSemanticGoalPlanner.gd` uses per-NPC deterministic RNG streams for semantic fallback target candidates.
- `NpcSystem.deterministic_profile_float()` uses a stable hash for deterministic profile timers.

Allowed `canFight` matches:

- `canFight` is used as a combat/threat capability in context, perception, and goal selection.
- Guard duty is assigned separately by guard roster/schedule state and is not inferred from `canFight`.

## 18. Risk Assessment For Next Phase

There is no next NPC pathfinding phase in this plan. Future NPC movement features should extend typed traversal actions, smart objects, semantic goals, traffic reservations, and door portals rather than adding direct movement loops or new `Main*.gd` layers.

## 19. Verdict

Phase 13 passes. The phase branch and merged `master` both passed the required all-runner gate, the final acceptance matrix has no unchecked mandatory row, and there is no unapproved deviation.
