# Phase 08 Report - Space-Time Traffic, Door Queues, Fairness, and Deadlock Recovery

## 1. Phase Identification

- Phase: 08 - Space-Time Traffic, Door Queues, Fairness, and Deadlock Recovery
- Branch: `npc-pathfinding/phase-08-traffic-deadlock`
- Date: 2026-06-26
- Scope status: branch and `master` gates pass after the intentional world-signature baseline refresh.
- Base commit before Phase 08 branch changes: `ffc85a144d6fcd22f71102552563896078e19933`
- Branch code commit: `89c2cd337fbd583b10f8ae3e54ddca8c0dfeb3d7`
- Merge commit: `c405b9163976a673b91138055dba91858bc8e137`
- Post-merge baseline line-ending guard commit: `80e330a09d3c30fa4b078b42ec889fd4dd446e35`

## 2. Objective

Phase 08 adds space-time reservation and traffic liveness controls for narrow resources that local avoidance cannot safely arbitrate: doors, bridges, stairs, corridor spans, directed edges, and interaction slots. The target is deterministic ordering, no adjacent swaps, bounded waiting, and leak-free release on route/action lifecycle changes.

## 3. Pre-Phase State And Baseline Decision

`git status --short` currently shows a modified tracked baseline:

```text
 M artifacts/baselines/world-signature/atlas-1492.json
```

That file is tracked regression data, not a save file or disposable runner output. The branch now adds baseline README files and runner guards so generated signatures cannot be written into `artifacts/baselines/`, and so a locally dirty baseline blocks comparison.

Baseline refresh evidence:

- Accepted baseline SHA-256: `05290360F4ACA4965AC3EB6EA6B4D5E886A01F52CE02E073D1B845DCA87A63D5`
- Fresh generated signature path: `artifacts/test-runners/world-signature-fresh-atlas-1492.json`
- Fresh generated signature SHA-256: `05290360F4ACA4965AC3EB6EA6B4D5E886A01F52CE02E073D1B845DCA87A63D5`
- Repeated generated signature artifacts under `artifacts/test-runners/` use the same `05290360...` hash.
- JSON section comparison old vs current:
  - `generatedBlocks`: same hash, count 1216/1216
  - `generatedTierCounts`: same hash
  - `loadedChunkKeys`: same hash, count 49/49
  - `structureCounts`: same hash, count 11/11
  - `terrainSamples`: same hash, count 12/12
  - `townHomeRecords`: same hash
  - `props`: changed hash, count 1136 -> 1124

The drift is deterministic and isolated to `props`. The regenerated signature is accepted intentionally as the tracked `atlas-1492` world-signature baseline for subsequent gates. It is not treated as disposable generated output.

After the branch merge, Git checkout converted the local baseline JSON to CRLF while the index remained LF. `.gitattributes` now locks `artifacts/baselines/world-signature/*.json` to LF so the byte-level world-signature comparison remains stable after future checkouts.

## 4. Implementation Summary

Added Phase 08 traffic services:

- `BottleneckClassifier`
- `TrafficReservationService`
- `SafeIntervalPlanner`
- `WaitForGraph`
- `TrafficPriorityPolicy`
- `TrafficReservation`

`TrafficReservationService` owns rolling-horizon reservations for spans, directed edges, portals, and interaction slots. It tracks resource reservations by owner, group, and resource, releases by group/owner/generation, expires old reservations, records active reservations and queues, and exposes liveness counters for waiting, max wait, queue length, starvation prevention, cycle detection, cycle resolution, and unresolved reasons.

`SafeIntervalPlanner` derives safe start/end windows from existing reservations. `WaitForGraph` stores actor wait dependencies and detects cycles. `TrafficPriorityPolicy` applies stable priority classes, wait aging, continuity, and inherited priority through wait-for chains.

`DoorTraversalExecutor` now routes NPC door crossing through traffic reservations before door hold/open authority. Door waits return staging data and traffic reasons. Active crossings retain portal group ownership until release. Cancels and portal destruction release traffic state.

`NpcLocomotionController` integrates traffic waits with route following. NPCs stop at staging positions rather than pushing into the threshold while a resource is reserved, and retreat/yield behavior stays route/motor based instead of direct transform displacement.

The test harness now defaults deterministic seed propagation to `atlas-1492` across registered gates, records seeds in reports, and rejects stale/partial reports using run tokens plus terminal `finished` markers.

## 6. Focused Traffic Evidence

Command:

```powershell
.\tools\npc\run-npc-traffic-tests.ps1 -TimeMode Both -Seed atlas-1492
```

Report:

- `artifacts/npc/reports/traffic-both.json`
- Seed: `atlas-1492`
- Time mode: both
- Result count: 38
- Failure count: 0
- Started UTC: `2026-06-26T22:35:02`
- Finished UTC: `2026-06-26T22:35:02`

Required IDs exercised in both day and night modes:

- `npc_traffic_two_actor_one_door_swap`
- `npc_traffic_node_and_edge_conflict`
- `npc_traffic_no_adjacent_edge_swap`
- `npc_traffic_bridge_direction_batch`
- `npc_traffic_stair_single_capacity`
- `npc_traffic_interaction_slot_capacity`
- `npc_traffic_four_actor_cycle_resolved`
- `npc_traffic_priority_emergency_over_wander`
- `npc_traffic_priority_night_home_over_idle`
- `npc_traffic_active_crossing_not_preempted`
- `npc_traffic_wait_age_prevents_starvation`
- `npc_traffic_priority_inheritance_chain`
- `npc_traffic_pullout_retreat_physical`
- `npc_traffic_cancel_releases_reservation`
- `npc_traffic_destroyed_portal_releases_reservation`
- `npc_traffic_no_permanent_deadlock_soak`
- `npc_traffic_day_work_wave`
- `npc_traffic_dusk_return_home_wave`
- `npc_traffic_night_guard_outbound_civilians_inbound`

Representative evidence:

- Door swap: second actor waits at stage with `door_reserved`/`traffic_wait`; reservations return to zero; door closes after last safe crossing.
- Node and directed-edge conflict: second actor is blocked by first owner, queue length observed.
- Adjacent edge swap: opposite traversal is denied while the first actor owns the directed edge.
- Bridge/stair/slot capacity: one-capacity resources serialize access and report blockers.
- Four-actor cycle: wait-for cycle is detected and resolved deterministically.
- Emergency/night-home priorities: higher-priority requests preempt or displace lower pending waits while active crossings retain continuity.
- Wait aging: starvation prevention counter increments and lower-priority actor reaches terminal state within the scenario bound.
- Owner lifecycle: cancel and destroyed portal cases release reservations and leave active reservation count at zero.
- Stress/wave cases: all actors reach terminal states, queue pressure is observed, and reservations return to zero.

## 8. Repository Gate Evidence On Branch

Initial command before baseline acceptance:

```powershell
.\tools\run-all-test-runners.ps1 -ReportPath artifacts\test-runners\phase08-all-test-runners-latest-report.json -Seed atlas-1492
```

Report:

- `artifacts/test-runners/phase08-all-test-runners-latest-report.json`
- Started UTC: `2026-06-26T22:34:46.6270219Z`
- Finished UTC: `2026-06-26T23:06:04.2835120Z`
- Duration: `1877.656` seconds
- Result count: 7
- Failure count: 1

Runner results:

- `npc_focused`: pass, `17.159` seconds, report fresh true
- `world_signature`: fail, `0.362` seconds, report fresh false
- `visual_manifest`: pass, `0.1` seconds
- `npc_navigation_legacy`: pass, `122.445` seconds, report fresh true
- `story_playtest`: pass, `71.778` seconds, report fresh true
- `visual_captures`: pass, `74.108` seconds, report fresh true
- `playtest`: pass, `1591.643` seconds, report fresh true

`world_signature` failed by design because `tools/run-world-signature.ps1` refused to compare while `artifacts/baselines/world-signature/atlas-1492.json` had unstaged local modifications. This result is superseded by the accepted baseline refresh and the required repository gate rerun.

## 9. Parser And Static Hygiene Evidence

Commands:

```powershell
git diff --check
```

Additional parser sweep:

- Godot parser checks passed for 20 changed or added GDScript files.
- PowerShell parser checks passed for 9 changed or added wrappers.
- No orphaned Godot process remained after the monitored all-runner.

## 10. Gate Audit

| Gate | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Traffic is time-aware, not frame-TTL cell ownership. | `TrafficReservationService` uses rolling-horizon start/end intervals through `SafeIntervalPlanner`; tests assert delayed interval starts and wait ages. | Pass on focused suites |
| Node and directed-edge conflicts are both enforced. | `npc_traffic_node_and_edge_conflict` and `npc_traffic_no_adjacent_edge_swap` pass in day/night. | Pass on focused suites |
| Deadlock cycles are detected and resolved deterministically. | `npc_traffic_four_actor_cycle_resolved` passes in day/night; wait-for cycle resolution counters are asserted. | Pass on focused suites |
| Priority and wait aging prevent starvation. | `npc_traffic_wait_age_prevents_starvation`, emergency priority, night-home priority, and inheritance-chain cases pass in day/night. | Pass on focused suites |
| Retreat/yield movement uses real routes and physics, not transform displacement. | `npc_traffic_pullout_retreat_physical` passes in day/night; locomotion waits use staging and route/motor movement rather than direct displacement. | Pass on focused suites |
| Door queues and traffic share one authority. | Door traversal executor owns traffic reservation before door hold/open and releases on crossing/cancel/destroy; door swap and portal destruction cases pass. | Pass on focused suites |
| Day/dusk/night traffic waves pass. | Day work, dusk return-home, and night guard/civilian inbound/outbound wave cases pass in day/night. | Pass on focused suites |
| All focused and repository runners pass on branch and `master`. | Focused runners pass; branch repository gate passes after the accepted baseline refresh; `master` repository gate passes after the non-fast-forward merge and LF baseline guard. | Pass |

## 11. Review Questions

Can two actors swap through each other?

- Focused edge-swap and node/directed-edge tests pass in both time modes. Opposite directed edge traversal waits behind the current owner instead of granting a conflicting interval.

What proves starvation cannot persist in tested conditions?

- Wait aging and priority-policy tests pass in both time modes. The traffic stats report max wait, queue pressure, and starvation prevention counters, and wave/soak cases require terminal actor states with zero active reservations at the end.

Are reservation lifetimes tied to action/route generations?

- Reservation requests carry owner generation data. The service releases stale owner generations and cancels by owner/group/generation. Cancel, route replacement, portal destruction, and actor lifecycle paths call the traffic release APIs.

Can a cancelled/deleted actor leak a resource?

- `npc_traffic_cancel_releases_reservation` and `npc_traffic_destroyed_portal_releases_reservation` pass in both time modes and assert zero active reservations after release.

Is deadlock recovery physical and deterministic?

- Cycle resolution uses a deterministic yielder plus pull-out/staging metadata. `npc_traffic_four_actor_cycle_resolved` and `npc_traffic_pullout_retreat_physical` pass in both time modes.
